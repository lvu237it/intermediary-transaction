# A project about Intermediary Transaction System from SWP391_G6_SE1755_NET

## Introduction

An intermediary trading system is a system that allows users to act as sellers and buyers. They can make transactions via the Internet with digital resources such as online documents, accounts, ... without having to directly transact face-to-face, helping both sellers and buyers. Save time as well as additional costs.
